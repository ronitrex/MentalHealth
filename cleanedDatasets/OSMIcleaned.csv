Yes,100-500,2019,34,31-40,Undecided,1,"Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder.  The context was a meeting between several coworkers, including one who was suffering greatly from anxiety, which was impeding her work. I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me.   It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship. As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself. I considered trying to explain but didn’t think I would be able to.

I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with.   Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep?  My supervisor was dumbfounded the first time he observed me during a (job-related) anxiety attack when I completely forgot how to do something simple and routine. He spent two hours asking me leading questions to help me solve my problem instead of gently reminding me. I thought I was going to cry. He said ""what can I do to help you"", made a few suggestions, faked empathy. And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully.

Work/life balance is tough to achieve, and work and life are not inherently separate, but priorities and boundaries need to be set. I told my team lead that I was feeling overwhelmed. He told me to take the rest of the day off (and the next one if I wanted), and reminded me that we have mental health services available.   I had a coworker confide in me that her manager was being unnecessarily overbearing and that the team wasn't sharing the workload equally. I suggested we get lunch outside of work, and there I asked if she was looking to move to a different team (I'm familiar with the team she was currently on). She has moved to a different team and says she is much more content. ",1,Above Average,Yes,USA,1,,Yes,Maybe,Maybe,             Yes     Yes Rarely Sometimes                              ,1,1

Yes,More than 1000,2019,24,21-30,Female,1,"  I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis. My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation. This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally.

I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc.      In Slack, a coworker stated he was depressed and needed the teams help understanding that.

I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about. We only have an HDHP and I find it difficult to justify therapy and mental healthcare when I will otherwise come nowhere near my deductible. Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan.   They told me they had similar experiences that I had spoken about and were looking for guidance and connection.

Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.

Yeah it's kinda embarrassing, but it happens to all of us at some point.  I tend to have anxiety/SAD and I've been pretty open about it with my close co-workers and what's been effective. It usually starts a ""me too"" dialog. Was just an FYI that I've been going through a foggy phase.  Wasn't a big deal at all and my boss asked what he could do to help.  He's been there, too.  Most people in my previous company worked remotely, which has pros and cons for certain kinds of mental health issues.  We'd have somewhat open conversations about the fact that it was a unique issue for our company, but I don't think any tailored program was ever created. I've had other co-workers ask me about how to manage anxiety, or swap stories about what triggers our attacks.  I feel like it has led to a deeper understanding and bond and we're better able to support each other.

Someone had a chat with me that was positive and talked about me levelling up. The next Monday after that, the head of HR and the head of the head of the whole department were on a surprise Skype call with me at 5 am their time to fire me, because I ""didn't appear happy"". When pressed by lawyers they said they didn't have to provide a reason. If they had done the written bit of their procedure, I could have submitted doctors' notes that I was going through stuff. But I wasn't going to just put that on the table when someone is having a ""casual chat"" about pathways and corrections and stuff, a first time chat.     This is tough stuff. I was talking to someone who I thought was pretty open minded and that I thought we were close, but he physically recoiled for a second when I told him what I was struggling with.

I have also been bullied by another boss and a manager at a small transportation company, Riolo Transportation (based in Carlsbad, CA) where they told me that since I had PTSD, they were unsure if they could trust me to do work. I don't see how either of those things correspond to each other, especially how I was a great worker and never caused any issues (if I made a mistake, I owned up to it and fixed it). I quit on the spot and they cussed me out.    They became some of my closest friends after I disclosed to them that I suffer from PTSD. I discussed my mental health with my previous company (Applied Predictive Technologies) and they used it against me. Any time I needed to go home early due to sickness, HR would ask if it was physical or mental. When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!)

Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews.

This person has recently received a lot of visibility for their success - they also now work remotely - so this is very much a success is the best revenge story. STILL.

I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment.

But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding. I have openly discussed my struggles with anxiety and complex PTSD with my team, including my supervisor. I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments   It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work.  I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...) I had many informal, personal conversations with one coworker -- they are my BF now, ten years later - about mental health because we had a lot in common.

I don't know,100-500,2018,30,21-30,Female,1,"  I try to be pretty open about my mental health with my coworkers, so this has happened a bunch. Often, I try to explain that the way daily checkin meetings are run is anxiety-provoking and decreases my productivity. Some are more understanding than others. My perception of the ""typical"" reaction is that they tell me I should go take a walk, or watch cute cat videos, or other armchair advice that really isn't sufficient for significant GAD/severe depression. That feels frustrating. I've had this discussion a ton of times. Most recently, we had a conversation where they told me I wasn't performing well enough and they were considering putting me on a PIP - after I'd told them I struggle with anxiety. Prior to that, I'd had a conversation with my manager where he was applying heavy pressure for a deadline and I tried to explain that high pressure escalates my anxiety makes me freeze and become less productive. He told me he likes pressure and maybe I didn't belong in that workplace.   Usually I start the conversation about my mental health. And then people will sometimes disclose their own struggles with anxiety or depression or other mental health concerns.

I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee.  The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently. When I was diagnosed with ADHD and began treatment, I discussed it with my boss and supervisor. At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed.

I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma. Was having a particularly bad anxiety episode that had lasted a few days and was negatively affecting work so I asked if I could take a few days off, and explained why. He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized.

I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward. Oh my... An open question... First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue.    One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor.
